### For practicing HTML, CSS, JS

### Current JS features:

- accordion
- pop-up modal
- alert
- tabs
- side menu with music icon (screen-width <= 1000px)

### To add:

- exiting out of modal by clicking outside of modal
- prevent scroll when modal is opened instead of overflow-y
- open side menu (screen-width <= 1000px) by mouse-over music icon and close side menu with mouse-off instead of clicking icon to open and close
- when opening an accordion any other open accordion automatically closes
